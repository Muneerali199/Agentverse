# **App Name**: AgentVerse

## Core Features:

- Visual Agent Builder: A drag-and-drop interface will provide users with an intuitive way to build and customize their AI agents. They'll be able to add, remove, and configure tools.
- Memory Module: Each agent can retain information from previous interactions, enabling more context-aware conversations.
- Tool Integration: Provide agents with the ability to access external tools, such as web browsers or simple APIs, allowing them to gather real-time information. Agents will use a tool selection module to use these tools.
- Agent Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard will be created where users can monitor the performance of their agents.
- Feedback Loop: User feedback is integrated in order to learn from interactions. Agent learns to select better responses from human feedback.
- Web App Deployment: Agent can be exported to a web app.
- Multi-Modal Interface: Enables agents to process multi-modal input, such as analyzing images or processing voice commands, enhancing their interaction capabilities.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#29ABE2) for reliability and intelligence. The choice of blue reflects the sophisticated functionality and innovative nature of the AI agent platform.
- Background color: Light blue (#E0F7FA) to maintain a clean, non-distracting environment.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFC107), a contrasting hue from the primary to draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) will be used for both body and headline text, to promote a neutral, objective feel.
- Consistent use of a set of clear, outline-style icons for key features
- Use a grid-based layout to maintain balance and structure throughout the interface
- Subtle animations such as micro-interactions and transitions to provide feedback.
